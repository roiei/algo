# algo

Hi, I'm Roy.
I updated some instructive here codes because I just want to share my codes throughout studying various kins of algorithms and data structures.
I'll be very happy if you update some codes of algorithm and data structure.

In the first commit, 
I added the following items.

A. data structure

  1. bst.py : binary search tree
  2. graph.py : undirected, directed, weighted graph, 
     DFS, BFS, MCST PFS, MCST Krukusal, PFS, Dijkstra
  3. hash_linear_probing.py : hash implementation with linear probing as collision avoidance
  4. hash_separate_chanining.py : hash implementation with separate chaining as collision avoidance
  5. prio.queue.py : priority queue implementation based on heap sort
  6. Set.py : set data structure
  
B. algorithms

  1. MazeGraph.py : algorithm to check if it is possible to get through to the exit point with the given array
  2. quick_sort.py : quick sort implementation
     recursive version, stack version
  3. sort.py : basic sort algorithms with O(N^2)
     select sort : i is from 0 to n-1, j is from i to n-1, 
     and compare i to j -> exchange
     
     insert sort : i is from 1 to n-1, j is from i to 0, 
     compare j-1 to j -> exchange
     
     boubble sort : i is from 0 to n-1, j is from 1 to n-i, 
     compare j-1 to j -> exchange
