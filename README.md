# algo

Hi, I'm Roy.
I updated some instructive codes here because I just want to share my codes written throughout studying various kins of algorithms and data structures.
I'll be very happy if you update some codes about algorithm and data structure.


A. data structure

  1. bst.py : binary search tree
  2. graph.py : undirected, directed, weighted graph, 
     DFS, BFS, MCST PFS, MCST Krukusal, PFS, Dijkstra
  3. hash_linear_probing.py : hash implementation with linear probing as collision avoidance
  4. hash_separate_chanining.py : hash implementation with separate chaining as collision avoidance
  5. prio.queue.py : priority queue implementation based on heap sort
  6. Set.py : set data structure
  
B. algorithms

  1. MazeGraph.py : algorithm to check if it is possible to get through to the exit point with the given array
  2. quick_sort.py : quick sort implementation
     recursive version, stack version
  3. sort.py : basic sort algorithms with O(N^2)

     select sort : i is from 0 to n-1, j is from i to n-1, 
     and compare i to j -> exchange
     
     insert sort : i is from 1 to n-1, j is from i to 0, 
     compare j-1 to j -> exchange
     
     boubble sort : i is from 0 to n-1, j is from 1 to n-i, 
     compare j-1 to j -> exchange
     
  4. merge_sort.py : merge sort using merge is added
     merge sort is merging two parts of source from the unit size 1 and the unit size is going to increased as multiple of 2
     
C. Problem Solving

1) Algorithm code for the problems from 'LeetCode'

2) Algorithm code for the problems from HackerRank, acmpic, etc.
